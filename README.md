# wrangle_project_DAND
Data wrangling project using twitter API for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

Hello World! In this repository I will go through my data warangling efforts gathering, assessing, and cleaning
and visualizing data of WeRateDog tweets.This is done as part of my [Data Analyst Nano Degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

## Background
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I  gather data from a variety of
sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data
wrangling. The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user
@dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a
humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators,
though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

## Objective

My final objective is to have a database with information about WeRateDogs tweets, including what dog type
it is (e.g golden retriever), what stage they are (e.g. pupper), their WeRateDogs rating (e.g. 14/10!) and how
many tweets and retweets they got.
